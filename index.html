                <h2>
                    The great Steve Vai
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The shred guru waxes poetic on his infamous 10-hour workout,
                    improvisation, and Bette Midler’s bees.

                    At this point in his 30-year career, there’s not much about
                    Steve Vai that hasn’t been covered before. Luckily, some of
                    our more astute Facebook fans kept Vai busy for nearly two
                    hours to talk about everything from the influence of his
                    former boss Frank Zappa to some setlist spoilers for his
                    upcoming Rock in Rio gig. Check out a few highlights from
                    Vai’s expansive Q&A below.
                    <ol id="list">
                        <li>
                            Vai is digging into his archives for his next
                            project.
                            Right now I’m working on the record that will be
                            included in
                            the 25th anniversary edition of Passion and Warfare
                            that
                            will come out next year. It’s music I’ve written or
                            tracked
                            between Flex-able and Passion and Warfare, kinda
                            like the
                            missing link. It’s pretty bizarre and wild. As a
                            matter of
                            fact, I just played Andy Alt one of the weirdest
                            solos I
                            think I ever did and he said, “That was the most
                            inside-out,
                            backwards, and flipped thing that ends up being so
                            right!”
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            When it comes to Vai’s immaculate technique, 11 is
                            the
                            magic number.
                            Practice very, very slow and perfect. If every note
                            doesn’t
                            sound like it has its own personality, roundness,
                            depth,
                            and
                            other perfections, then start slower. Then slowly
                            bring
                            the
                            speed up and master perfectly, effortlessly, and
                            beautifully
                            what you’re playing at least 11 times in a row
                            without
                            making one mistake. Then get a little faster.
                            Patience
                            is of
                            vital importance, but of even more importance is
                            that
                            you
                            enjoy every note and put your full attention into
                            the
                            soul
                            of every note.

                        <li>
                            His 10-hour workouts are a thing of the past.
                            If I still did those I would be as good as some
                            people
                            think
                            I am.
                        </li>

                        <li>Improvisation and composition are neighbors in Vai’s
                            solos.
                            Sometimes when I’m in the studio working on a solo,
                            I
                            break
                            it down and work on one section at a time until
                            something
                            comes out that doesn’t sound like anything I’ve
                            heard or
                            played before. I usually can’t do that on the fly,
                            so
                            I’ll
                            need to meditate on an idea. I then work on that
                            idea
                            until
                            it’s vocabulary becomes second nature to me. So
                            certain
                            solos may be duplicated live very close to the
                            original
                            but
                            there’s always space for pure improv. I enjoy doing
                            both
                            equally.
